It was therefore almost inevitable that his chosen career would be Architecture. As through design, it unites the physical qualities of built form, material application, response to the environment and applicable technology with the creative arts, mathematical theories of form and proportion, human emotional response and history. This dichotomy pervades everything he does whether it is work related or social.\n\nWith his 25 years' experience he has delivered a wide range of landmark and award winning projects ranging from industrial, residential, retail, commercial and high end hospitality for clients from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Clients include the V&A Waterfront, Old Mutual, Sew Eurodrive, Robertson and Cain, Jumeirah Group, One & Only Resorts, Southern Sun, Fairmont, Hilton, Emaar, Mediclinic, City Hospital and Diyar.\n\nRussell's passion is sailing and he has taken part in many world class races including 'Fastnet', 'Cowes Regatta', Cape Town to Rio and Cape Town to St. Helena to name but a few.\n\nHe continues sailing here at Dubai Offshore Sailing Club in his spare time on his yacht Sovereign."

        "description": "The brief was to capture the spirit of 1960's 'swinging London'. Taking inspiration from the radical art, fashion, film and music scenes that flourished during this period, generating new ideas and creating a youth phenomenon that strongly emphasized the new and the modern, a time of optimism and hedonism, a rebellion against the artistic and social norms, creating an explosive cultural revolution.\n\nInfinite's design concept reconsidered the typical hotel guestroom configuration to deliver a revolutionary guest experience through a contemporary interpretation of the sixties counterculture that questioned the political, social and moral values of the time.\n\nThe available area is split on the diagonal forming two primary asymmetric volumes which are then further divided via a series of overlapping vertical and horizontal planes shaped to facilitate their function. The detailing of these planes is intentionally simple to ensure the space remains uncluttered, a quality that is further supported by the selection of finishes. The result is a series of clean formed visually linked inter-leading areas, each with its own easily recognizable identity and function.\n\nAlthough the layout is designed to feel unrestricted, selected areas are highlighted through use of vibrant colour reminiscent of the media and symbolism of the sixties. These include a large kaleidoscopic mural, the psychedelic artwork derived from the experience of altered consciousness having been modernized into algorithmic art.\n\nThe design, the functionality and the experience of the room are complimented harnessing today's new media and technologies, with fully integrated in-room operating systems all controlled from the guest's smart phone. The aim is to create a living environment that exudes ease-of-use and exceeds the expectations of today's discerning guest.\n\nThe design, which was conceived, detailed and built in collaboration with Guttman Interiors in a period of six weeks, was announced as the Winner of the Sleep Event Competition at the Business Design Centre, London."
